# Alta Ship Pet - Narfin

A small mod that replaces alta ship pet drones with snuggets - kind-looking big fluffy creatures made from solar power.

Currently includes 10 variations (check the screenshots).

Requires ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/bookmarks/icons/ct_alterash_planet.png) [My Enternia](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia) to function.

That's it.
